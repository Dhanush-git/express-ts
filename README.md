# Express with TypeScript

This is a starter template for building an Express application with TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

3. Build the TypeScript code by running the following command:

  ```
  npm run build
  ```

4. Start the server by running the following command:

  ```
  npm start
  ```

  The server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development

During development, you can use the following command to run the server with live-reloading:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the server using `nodemon` and automatically restart it whenever you make changes to the code.

## Build

To build the TypeScript code into JavaScript, you can use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript files into the `dist` directory.

## Start

To start the server in production mode, you can use the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the server using the compiled JavaScript files in the `dist` directory.
